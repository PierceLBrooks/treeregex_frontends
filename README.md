# TreeRegex Frontends

This repo contains a set of frontends to turn source code or other tree-structured text into serialized trees (abbreviated 'sexp').  

For each frontend, there is a folder.  Inside the folder, there are directions on how to operate the frontend and what is necessary to run the frontend in the README.md for that folder.

The following frontends are available:
* C/C++/Objective-C: This is in the cpp folder (Objective-C is in beta)
* JavaScript: This is the js folder
* Python: This is in the python folder
