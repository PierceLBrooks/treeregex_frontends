# Python 2&3 frontend

This frontend converts Python 2/3 to serialized tree form.  To run it, you must have the packages from the requirements.txt installed.

It supports the following flags:

	`-nws` which strips whitespace
	`-l` which labels each subtree
	`-t` which does token-level subtrees (instead of just grammar level subtrees)
